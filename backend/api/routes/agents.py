Agent status and execution routes.

Per-agent work dispatch
-----------------------
Each of the four pipeline agents maps to a distinct backend worker:

  s1  Scraper             run_discovery_cycle() + SCRAPER_MANAGER.run_all()
                          — discovers new jobs from LinkedIn + all board scrapers.
                          run_discovery_cycle manages all four agent states
                          internally via agent_store, so _run_agent_scrape
                          skips the outer set_active / set_idle for s1.

  s2  Sourcing Specialist feed_service.refresh_user_scores(user_id)
                          — computes ATS match_score for every unscored new job.

  s3  Content Strategist  jd_backfill_service.backfill_jd_text(user_id)
                          — fetches full JD text for jobs that only have thin
                            metadata, enabling richer scoring downstream.

  s4  Quality Guard       feed_service.force_rescore_all(user_id)
                          — re-evaluates match scores for ALL existing jobs,
                            picking up profile changes or score-logic updates.

Concurrency model — asyncio.create_task()
-----------------------------------------
FastAPI's BackgroundTasks drains tasks sequentially after the response:
  for task in self.tasks: await task()
This means a second click always waits behind the first — the deadlock.

asyncio.create_task() schedules the coroutine immediately as an independent
Task on the already-running event loop.  The endpoint returns HTTP 200 at
once; multiple agents for the same user, or the same agent for different
users, run fully concurrently and interleave at every await.

Duplicate-run guard
-------------------
_active_runs stores "user_id:agent_id" keys.  Each agent has its own slot,
so s2 can run while s1 is in flight.  The finally block always discards the
key — timeout, crash, or success all release the lock.

Timeout
-------
Each runner is wrapped in asyncio.wait_for(timeout=_PIPELINE_TIMEOUT_S).
On expiry the coroutine is cancelled; its own finally blocks still execute
(Python guarantees this), agents are reset to idle, and the triggering card
surfaces a human-readable error.

    Master pipeline task — scheduled via asyncio.create_task() by /sync.

    Runs all four agents sequentially:  s1 → s2 → s3 → s4.

    Each step runs to completion (or hits its own timeout) before the next
    begins, so downstream agents always see the freshest data from upstream.

    A failed step sets that agent's state to error but does NOT abort the
    remaining steps — s2/s3/s4 can still process existing data even if s1
    produced nothing new this cycle.

    State wipe (second pass)
    ------------------------

    schedules the coroutine on the event loop but does not run it synchronously.

    the first await inside this coroutine, potentially dirtying agent state
    again.  The second pipeline_reset() at coroutine entry closes that window
