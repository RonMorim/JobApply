"""
Pre-scrape relevancy gate.

is_title_relevant(title) — a fast, zero-network title check used by every
scraper before any detail-page fetch or DB write.  If the job title does
not contain at least one target keyword (or a recognised synonym / abbreviation),
the job is silently discarded so no HTTP requests, LLM calls, or DB rows are
wasted on irrelevant postings.

Design
------
• Builds a single compiled regex from TARGET_SEARCH_QUERIES (config.py)
  plus an explicit set of short aliases that require whole-word matching.
• Normalises input with NFD + strip-Mn so that Hebrew nikud and combined
  Unicode diacritics don't cause false negatives.
• Multi-word phrases are matched as substrings (e.g. "Product Manager"
  matches "Senior Product Manager, Israel").
• Short abbreviations (PM, PO, GPM …) use \\b word-boundary anchors so
  they do not match as substrings of unrelated tokens (e.g. "npm", "RPM").
• The compiled regex is lazily initialised and cached at module level.
  Call reset_pattern() to recompile after changing config (tests only).
