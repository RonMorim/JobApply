"""
Abstract base class for all job-source scrapers.

Each concrete adapter targets one ATS or career-page provider (Comeet,
Greenhouse, Lever, etc.).  All adapters share the same contract:

    fetch_jobs() -> list[JobMatch]

The returned JobMatch objects have real scraped data (title, company,
location, apply_url, jd_text) but zero AI scores (score=0, match_score=0).
Scoring is deferred to feed_service.refresh_user_scores() so that a single
scrape run covering 50+ companies doesn't block on LLM calls.
