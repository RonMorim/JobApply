"""
JD Backfill Service — fetches full job description text for jobs that currently
hold only thin proxy content (title + company, < 100 chars).

Entry point:
    await backfill_jd_text(user_id, min_score=50.0)

Behaviour:
1. Selects jobs for user_id with score >= min_score and short/missing jd_text.
2. Scrapes each job's apply_url using the existing url_scraper.scrape_job_post().
3. Persists the raw_text via job_store.update_jd_text().
4. After the loop, calls feed_service.force_rescore_all() so proficiency-aware
   ATS scoring fires on the newly populated JD content.

Rate limiting: 1.0–1.5 s jitter between requests to avoid hammering sources.
LinkedIn URLs returning HTTP 999 / 403 are caught and skipped gracefully.
