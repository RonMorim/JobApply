Feed-level services: batch ATS scoring and profile-to-cv-proxy conversion.

refresh_user_scores(user_id)
─────────────────────────────
Idempotent enrichment pass (s2).  Validates every job's JD integrity before
scoring — if the stored text is thin, it hydrates first.  The trigger
condition is intentionally broad:

    len(jd_text) < _JD_MIN_CHARS   OR   why_ron IS NULL

This means a job that carries a why_ron string from a previous DEV mock but
still holds a thin placeholder JD is treated as un-enriched and re-processed.

hydrate_job(job)
────────────────
Single gateway for all live JD fetching.  Uses unauthenticated requests only —
no cookies, no Playwright, no ScraperAPI.  On failure it writes
_HYDRATE_FAILED_SENTINEL to the jd_text column so the job is permanently
excluded from retry loops without requiring a schema change.
LinkedIn challenge/redirect errors are treated as transient (no penalty).

force_rescore_all(user_id)
───────────────────────────
Re-runs local proxy scoring for every job that is NOT fully enriched.
"Fully enriched" means: why_ron IS NOT NULL  AND  jd_text IS rich.
A job with why_ron set but thin text is NOT considered fully enriched and
is re-scored here (local proxy only — LLM is not called from s4).

    STRATEGY

    Three passes per cycle:

    Pass A — Identify candidates
        All jobs where _needs_enrichment() is True:
          • jd_text thin (< 250 chars, not a failure sentinel)  ← catches DEV
            mock rows whose why_ron was set but JD is still a placeholder
          • why_ron IS NULL  ← never received a real LLM evaluation

    Pass B — Hydrate thin jobs
        For each candidate whose jd_text is thin, hydrate_job() fetches the
        real employer JD from apply_url before the LLM sees it.  On failure,
        _HYDRATE_FAILED_SENTINEL is persisted and the job is removed from the
        enrichment batch for this cycle (it will be re-evaluated next cycle
        only if _needs_enrichment still returns True — which it won't for the
        sentinel, preventing an infinite retry loop).

    Pass C — Score with Claude
        compute_match_score_async(run_llm_validation=True) computes the full
        3-component composite (30% local + 50% semantic + 20% management).
        If jd_text is still thin after hydration (sentinel or empty), the
        match_score_service LLM guard fires and only Phase 1 runs — no wasted
        API call.
