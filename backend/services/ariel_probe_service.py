ArielProbeService
=================
Drives Ariel's structured discovery sessions for entities whose confidence
score is below the probe threshold.

Probe methodology branches on entity_type
------------------------------------------
  skill      → STAR (Situation / Action / Result)
                Validates concrete execution: measurable outcome required.
  domain /
  experience → SCOPE (Scale / Cross-functional / Trade-off)
                Validates contextual mastery: breadth, structural clarity,
                judgment.  Quantitative metrics are OPTIONAL, not required.
  trait      → SIGNAL (Observable behaviour / Personal ownership / Change)
                Validates authentic behavioural patterns.  Scores on
                authenticity and demonstrated change, not hard metrics.

Design contract
---------------
• get_pending_probes()     — find entities that need probing (score < 70,
                             no probe in the last PROBE_COOLDOWN_H hours,
                             no manual_review_required block).
• get_probe_question()     — return the type-appropriate turn question for
                             the current probe turn (1–3).
• evaluate_probe_response()— LLM-backed rubric evaluation; selects the
                             correct evaluator based on entity_type.
• record_probe_outcome()   — writes ariel_probe_log, then calls either
                             ingest_conversation_event() (positive) or
                             ingest_negative_flag() (shallow/contradiction).

Safety invariant
----------------
Only one entity may be actively probed per session.  The caller must finish
(or abandon) the current probe before requesting the next one.

Integration
-----------
All evidence mutations go through ProfileUpdateService to guarantee that the
audit log and confidence re-computation are always triggered.

Usage sketch
------------
    service = ArielProbeService(engine, ProfileUpdateService(engine))
    targets = service.get_pending_probes(user_id)
    if targets:
        entity  = targets[0]
        session = profile_update_service.open_session(user_id, "star_probe",
                      target_entities=[entity["entity_id"]])

        q1 = service.get_probe_question(entity, turn=1)
        # ... collect user answers over 3 turns ...
        result = await service.evaluate_probe_response(transcript, entity, session_id=session)
        service.record_probe_outcome(user_id, entity, session, result)
