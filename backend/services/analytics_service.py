"""
Analytics service — daily activity KPIs for one user's Overview dashboard.

compute_overview(user_id) -> dict
  {
    "jobs_scanned_today":  int,    # JobRow created since UTC midnight today
    "actions_taken_today": int,    # applications submitted since UTC midnight today
    "average_match_score": float,  # AVG(JobRow.match_score) across scored jobs, 1dp
  }

The Overview is a *daily snapshot* ("here's what happened overnight"), so the
two activity counters MUST reset to 0 at UTC midnight. Lifetime/static metrics
(top strengths, total tailored-CV count) do not belong here — they live on the
dedicated Analytics page. `average_match_score` is kept as a stable quality
signal, the third KPI in the strip.

Date-filtering strategy — why substr, not a full-ISO `>=` compare
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Timestamp columns are stored as strings in INCONSISTENT formats across the app:
  created_at → "2026-07-02T08:18:33.114244+00:00"   (ISO-8601, 'T', +00:00)
  applied_at → "2026-07-02 08:13 UTC"                (space sep, ' UTC' suffix)
Comparing a whole timestamp string with `>=` against a computed midnight ISO
boundary is therefore fragile: any mismatch in separator, offset, or precision
makes the lexicographic comparison wrong, and the counter silently stops
resetting (the "stuck on 8 for days" bug). Instead we compare only the leading
YYYY-MM-DD date prefix (`substr(col, 1, 10)`) to today's UTC date. Both storage
formats begin with exactly that prefix, and it flips at 00:00 UTC — so the
counters reset every day *by construction*, independent of the rest of the
string's shape.

Tenant isolation
----------------
Every query filters by user_id == user_id. The user_id comes exclusively from
the verified JWT (CurrentUser) at the route layer, never from the client.
