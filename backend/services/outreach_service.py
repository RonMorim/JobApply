"""
OutreachService — generate personalized LinkedIn outreach messages.

Three message types
--------------------
1. CONSULTATION  (Step 1 — "Foot in the Door")
   A short, warm opening message to a Hiring Manager (Director, VP, C-level)
   asking for a 5-minute professional conversation or advice.
   NEVER mentions the job opening or asks for a referral.
   Goal: start a human relationship before revealing intent.

2. ESCALATION    (Step 2 — 24–48 hrs after a positive response)
   A follow-up that transitions the relationship into a referral request.
   Includes a ready-to-forward, 3rd-person executive summary of Ron's fit
   so the manager can forward it internally with zero effort.

3. HEADHUNTER    (Direct recruiter/agency routing)
   Targeted message to agency recruiters (Gotfriends, Nisha, SQLink, etc.)
   Leads with domain expertise, trajectory, and immediate readiness.
   Designed to land in the "place immediately" mental bucket.

All messages are grounded exclusively in USER_PROFILE data.
The LLM is forbidden from inventing experience, metrics, or claims.

You are a senior career strategist who writes highly targeted LinkedIn outreach \

• Output ONLY the raw message text — no subject line, no markdown, no meta-commentary.
