CV Aggregation Service — multi-file text extraction + LLM deduplication.

Public API
----------
    extract_text(content: bytes, filename: str) -> str
    aggregate_cv_claims(texts: list[str], user_id: str) -> dict

The aggregator accepts raw file bytes (PDF or DOCX), extracts plain text,
then passes all combined text through a single LLM call that produces a
structured ``cv_claims`` object:

    {
      "skills":      ["Python", "Product Management", ...],
      "experiences": [
        {
          "company":   "Acme Corp",
          "role":      "Senior PM",
          "start":     "2021",
          "end":       "2024",
          "summary":   "Led a cross-functional team..."
        },
        ...
      ],
      "education":   [

        }
      ],
      "summary":     "Concise professional background paragraph"
    }

The result is intentionally labelled as *claims* — unverified text scraped
from uploaded CVs.  Jonathan uses this as a basis for gap-analysis probing,
not as established fact.

    Date-Anchor Overrides Text Rule
    ================================
    After LLM extraction, audit the 'summary' field for "X+ years"
    claims that exceed the years computable from the DOMAIN-SPECIFIC
    dated experience entries.  When a contradiction is found:

      1. Discard the inflated claim (treat as CV boilerplate / typo).
      2. Replace it with the date-anchored figure: "<N> years".
      3. Append "(date-anchored)" so downstream consumers see the correction.

    Key insight: "5+ years of SaaS experience" must be validated against
    ONLY the SaaS-classified experience entries, NOT total professional
    tenure.  A candidate with 3 years SaaS + 3 years insurance has 6 years
    total but only 3 years of SaaS — the summary claim of "5+ SaaS" is
    wrong even though total tenure matches.

_AGGREGATION_SYSTEM = """\
You are a strict information-extraction engine.

You will be given raw text extracted from one or more CV documents.
Your task is to aggregate and deduplicate this information into a single
structured JSON object.

ABSOLUTE RULES:
- Extract ONLY what is explicitly stated in the source text.
- Never invent, infer, or embellish any value.
- If the same company or role appears in multiple CVs with slightly different
  wording, merge them into one entry and keep the most detailed version.
- Skills should be deduplicated (case-insensitive).
- Output ONLY a valid raw JSON object — no markdown, no explanation, no preamble.
- Extract ALL skills present — do not cap or truncate the skills array.
- Extract ALL functional and industry domains present — do not cap at 2-4;
  emit every distinct domain the candidate has operated in (Ops, Finance,
  Legal, Product, Insurance, SaaS, etc. are all valid separate domains).
- Extract ALL experiences, including cross-functional roles and secondments.

DATE-ANCHOR OVERRIDES TEXT RULE (critical):
- When writing the "summary" field, cross-validate any generic "X+ years of
  [domain]" claims against the explicit, dated job entries you are extracting.
- Compute the actual tenure from start/end years in the experience list.
- If a generic summary phrase claims MORE years than the dated timeline
  supports, DISCARD the generic phrase and use the date-anchored figure
  instead.  Example: summary says "5+ years of SaaS experience" but the
  only SaaS role in the experience list is 2023–2025 → write "3 years of
  SaaS experience (2023-2025)" in the summary, not "5+ years".
- Generic boilerplate ("X+ years") is treated as noise when it contradicts
  explicit dates.  Dated job boundaries are ground truth.

OUTPUT SCHEMA (all fields required, use empty list/string/array if not found):
{
  "skills": [
    "exact skill string — emit every distinct skill found, no upper limit"

  "domains": [
    "one high-level professional domain string per distinct domain the candidate
