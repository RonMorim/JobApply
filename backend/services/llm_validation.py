"""
LLM input validation & prompt-integrity hardening.

Two defenses against prompt injection through user-controlled text (CV content,
job descriptions, chat/tool input):

  1. SYSTEM_INTEGRITY_DIRECTIVE — a fixed instruction appended to every system
     prompt that reasons over untrusted text, telling the model to keep obeying
     its original instructions and treat user text as data, not commands.

  2. sanitize_text() — strips the control characters most commonly used to smuggle
     fake "system" turns or hide override instructions, and caps length so a
     hostile document can't exhaust the context window.

Neither is a complete guarantee (no prompt-level defense is), but together they
raise the cost of an injection materially while never altering legitimate text.
