patch_mint_direct.py
====================
1. Verifies jd_text is injected into the Mint PM job (patches if missing).
2. Flags score_is_proxy=1 + clears why_ron so _needs_enrichment() picks it up.
3. Clears all LinkedIn block keys from kv_store.
4. Directly calls compute_match_score_async with the full LLM pipeline and
   writes the resulting match_score + why_ron + score_is_proxy=0 back to the DB.

Exact column names verified from backend/services/db.py:
  table  : jobs
  PK     : job_id  (String)
  JD text: jd_text (Text)
  flags  : score_is_proxy (Boolean), enrichment_failures (Integer)
  kv_store PK: key (String)

Company Description
Mint is an Israeli digital agency building B2C websites and apps for the \
country's leading brands — Bank Hapoalim, Ashtrom, Delek Motors, Histadrut, and more.

Overview
Looking for a rockstar Project Manager — early in their product journey.

About the Role
- Lead digital projects end-to-end — from the first client brief through launch
- Serve as the main professional point of contact for clients: managing \
expectations, running status meetings, documenting decisions
- Write PRDs, specs, and user stories at a level that lets development run \
without getting stuck
- Work closely with development, design, and QA teams — translating client \
needs into clear work plans
- Identify product opportunities and manage scope changes in a structured way

Qualifications — Experience
- 1-3 years of experience managing digital projects (websites / apps / web systems)
- Proven experience working directly with clients, ideally large organizations
- Experience writing specs / PRDs / user stories
- Proficiency with project management tools (Jira / Monday / Asana)
- Experience working with both in-house and external development teams
- Experience with B2C clients

Qualifications — Mindset
- A genuine love for clients — not patience, love. Real curiosity about their business
- Backbone: the ability to say no to clients when needed and protect the team
- Emerging product mindset — curiosity about the why behind user behavior, \
not just the what
- Obsessive organization — if something falls through the cracks, it will keep \
you up at night
- Initiative and ownership — does not wait to be told what to do

Nice to Have
- Experience at a digital agency or software house
- Familiarity with Umbraco

Why Join Us
- Clear growth path to Product Manager within the team
- Exposure to a wide variety of clients, industries, and technologies
- A team that believes a great PM is half the success of any project — not \
the person who updates Jira
